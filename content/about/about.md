# Introduction

Hello,

I go by **ramsy0dev**, i am a self-tauth developer and cybersecurity intermedier from Galaxy.

I'm currently working on my own startup called [PufferBlow](https://github.com/PufferBlow), it's an open source privacy focused Discord alternative and one day i want to turn it into a **fediverse network**.
